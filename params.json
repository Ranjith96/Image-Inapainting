{"name":"Image-inapainting","body":"---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nINSTALLATION AND RUNNING\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n1. Make sure you have Java Runtime Environment. Otherwise download and \r\n   install jre from \r\n   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\r\n   by following the installation guide there. \r\n\r\n2. Run \"Executable/ImageInpainting.jar\" by double clicking on it or \r\n   cd to the folder where ImageInpainting.jar is present and \r\n   type the following: \r\n   java -jar \"ImageInpainting.jar\"\r\n   \r\n   IMPORTANT: If double clicking opens some other thing, such as \r\n   the nokia application installer, then close it and again try \r\n   to open the software by right clicking on it and \"Open With\"\r\n   Java. If this option doesn't appear, then you probably \r\n   have some problems with your Java installation. \r\n\r\n3. For any other help on how to use the software, you may get the help \r\n   from the user interface of the software by clicking on the help \r\n   button on the menu bar.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTROUBLESHOOTING\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nNote: The process for inpainting is slow and might take some time.\r\nWe recommend using Fast Inpainting option (ctrl+f) for inpainting. \r\nCurrently the software doesn't work well for largre images. For \r\nbetter results, test the software on small images. \r\nIf you face any problems with the inpainting, try to resize image \r\nto smaller dimensions before giving it as input to the software. \r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFOR DEVELOPERS\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n1. IMPORTANT: Make sure you do not play with the license headers. \r\n\r\n2. Make sure you have Java Development Kit. Otherwise install the \r\n   JDK from \r\n   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\r\n\r\n3. We recommend Net Beans for the development. However it is not \r\n   compulsary. You may use any IDE you like.\r\n\r\n4. The source code is in \"Image Inpainting/\" folder.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nHELP AND DOCUMENTATION\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFor seeing the documentation, see \"Documentation/index.html\".\r\n\r\nFor any additional help, visit http://sapandiwakar.wordpress.com \r\nOR http://pulkitgoyal.wordpress.com or mail to \r\npulkit110@gmail.com or diwakar.sapan@gmail.com\r\n\r\nOur research publication titled \"Fast and Enhanced Algorithm for \r\nExemplar Based Image Inpainting\" on which this implementation is \r\nbased can be found at\r\nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=5673977\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUSE IN OTHER SOFTWARES\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPlease obtain permissions from the developers if you wish to use \r\nthe code for personal or commercial uses.
