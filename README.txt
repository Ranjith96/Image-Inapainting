INSTALLATION AND RUNNING
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Make sure you have Java Runtime Environment. Otherwise download and 
   install jre from 
   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
   by following the installation guide there. 

2. Run "Executable/ImageInpainting.jar" by double clicking on it or 
   cd to the folder where ImageInpainting.jar is present and 
   type the following: 
   java -jar "ImageInpainting.jar"
   
   IMPORTANT: If double clicking opens some other thing, such as 
   the nokia application installer, then close it and again try 
   to open the software by right clicking on it and "Open With"
   Java. If this option doesn't appear, then you probably 
   have some problems with your Java installation. 

3. For any other help on how to use the software, you may get the help 
   from the user interface of the software by clicking on the help 
   button on the menu bar.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: The process for inpainting is slow and might take some time.
We recommend using Fast Inpainting option (ctrl+f) for inpainting. 
Currently the software doesn't work well for largre images. For 
better results, test the software on small images. 
If you face any problems with the inpainting, try to resize image 
to smaller dimensions before giving it as input to the software. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
FOR DEVELOPERS
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. IMPORTANT: Make sure you do not play with the license headers. 

2. Make sure you have Java Development Kit. Otherwise install the 
   JDK from 
   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

3. We recommend Net Beans for the development. However it is not 
   compulsary. You may use any IDE you like.

4. The source code is in "Source Code/" folder.
